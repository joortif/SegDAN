# dataset_path: Path to the directory containing the images and optionally their corresponding labels. 
# The directory must have subdirectories "/images" for the images and "/labels" for the labels.
dataset_path: C:/Users/joortif/Desktop/datasets/Completos/CherryCoffeeBeanSeg/test

# output_path: Path for the output and results of the program: analysis, clustering, reduction, transformation, metric comparison results
# and best model.
output_path: C:/Users/joortif/Desktop/Resultados_SegDAN/CherryCoffeeBeanSeg_test

# verbose: If set to true, this flag enables more detailed logging during the analysis, training and validation phases.
# It provides useful information about the modelâ€™s training progress, performance on the validation set, and any issues during the process.
# Defaults to false for reduced output.
verbose: true

# binary: Flag to indicate that the segmentation task is binary, meaning there are only two classes: foreground (target) and background. 
# If set to false, the task would be multi-class (more than two classes), typically used for semantic segmentation 
# with multiple object classes. Defaults to false.
binary: false

# background: Specifies the class label for background pixels in the segmentation task. 
# For example, if the model is performing semantic segmentation on an image, background pixels would be assigned this label.
# If no background is provided, it is assumed that no background class exists in the dataset and won't be ignored when calculating the metrics.
background: 5

# batch_size: Specifies the number of samples that will be processed together in one iteration during model training.
# A larger batch size speeds up training (to some extent) but requires more memory, while a smaller batch size might increase training time 
# but reduces memory usage. Recommended to experiment based on your hardware and dataset size
batch_size: 8

# Paths to configuration files for analysis and training.
analysis:
  config_path: ./analysis_config.yaml

training:
